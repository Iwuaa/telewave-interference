# Telewave - Basic instructions

(The game is avaliable in [many languages](/telewave/lang/langs))

* [Good video explaining the game](https://youtu.be/KuL_R60_320?t=225)
* The basis of this implementation is that **each seed generates a unique board**.
  * This means that when two people input the same seed, they will have the same target position and words.
  * It is possible then for the **clue giver** to open the board on their own computer/phone and **peek** at the target without having to share it in the videocall.
  * The copy button besides the seed will automatically copy a link with the current seed to the clipboard.
* Functions:
  * Seed: generates a unique board. The seed can be **any combination of numbers and letters**. (Tip: using words makes it easier to share the seed.)
  * New clue: generates a new random seed.
  * Guess: Compares your current position of the dial against the target, and shows you how many points you got.
  * Peek: reveals the target.
  * Clear: Erases the target and guess from the board.
  * Percentages: Toggles the display of the percentages under the dial. (The official rulebook advises against using percentages to discuss the dial, yet I've found that they make playing via videocall much easier.)
  * There are two manual score boards at the bottom for keeping track of your points.

Telewave on steroids - guess on two axes at the same time!

# Sounds Fishy
1. To start you’ll need a minimum of four people.
2. Choose a player to be the Guesser. Their mission is to identify the fake answers from the real one.
3. Ask the Guesser to close their eyes. Secretly choose a new player to be the True Blue Kipper. (Make sure the
Guesser doesn’t know who.) Their mission is to say the answer on the card.
4. Everyone else: you’re the Red Herrings. Each of you must make up a fake answer to the question.
5. Before you tell the Guesser they can open their eyes, make sure the other players have seen the question, and the question card is hidden from the Guesser.
6. Ok, now a player reads out the question and each player says their answer.
7. The Guesser now has to decide which answers were fake. If they correctly guess a fake answer, they win a point. They can stop and bank their points whenever they like, but if they hook the real answer before the end of the round, they lose them  all.
8. The player with the most points after you run out of cards is the winner.
