(The game is avaliable in [many languages](/telewave/lang/langs))

* [Good video explaining the game](https://youtu.be/KuL_R60_320?t=225)
* The basis of this implementation is that **each seed generates a unique board**.
  * This means that when two people input the same seed, they will have the same target position and words.
  * It is possible then for the **clue giver** to open the board on their own computer/phone and **peek** at the target without having to share it in the videocall.
  * The copy button besides the seed will automatically copy a link with the current seed to the clipboard.
* Functions:
  * Seed: generates a unique board. The seed can be **any combination of numbers and letters**. (Tip: using words makes it easier to share the seed.)
  * New clue: generates a new random seed.
  * Guess: Compares your current position of the dial against the target, and shows you how many points you got.
  * Peek: reveals the target.
  * Clear: Erases the target and guess from the board.
  * Percentages: Toggles the display of the percentages under the dial. (The official rulebook advises against using percentages to discuss the dial, yet I've found that they make playing via videocall much easier.)
  * There are two manual score boards at the bottom for keeping track of your points.

Telewave on steroids - guess on two axes at the same time!

### The aim of the game

In Sounds Fishy, you’ll be trying to reel in the questioner with your lie; tempting them with a slippery red herring, or convincing them the true blue kipper is just bait.

### Setup

Pick a  guesser and give them the stack of question cards with the blue answer facing down.
Take an amount of fish equal to the number of remaining players, making sure they’re all red herrings apart from one - the true blue kipper.
Serve them at random to each other player, face down so that the colour can't be seen.
Take a peek at your little  fishy, but don’t let the guesser see!

### Gameplay

Each round the guesser draws a question, holds it up with the blue answer facing away from them, so everyone else can see and reads it aloud.

Then, everyone has 15 seconds to craft a fishy little answer.

- **Red Herrings** must attempt to make the guesser think their lie is the truth.
- **The True Blue Kipper** must give the answer on the back of the card, while making it sound suspicious.

Now the guesser goes to work, trying to sort the fishy facts from fiction. Going around the table they must eliminate red herrings, flipping over fish one by one.

### Scoring

**If you're the guesser:**

- For every red herring you catch, score 1 point.
- Catch all the red herrings, without turning over the true blue kipper and score 1 bonus point.
- If the blue kipper lands in your net, you score nothing at all!

If you’re a frightened fisherman, you can stop guessing and bank the points of your measly little haul.

**If you're a fish:**

- **Red Herrings** score 1 point for every fish flipped, including the Kipper.
  However, if your fish gets flipped, you score nothing.
- **The True Blue Kipper** is the opposite - they gain 1 point for every un-flipped fish on the table. If they don’t get flipped, they score nothing.

### Game End

After scoring concludes, pass the cards clockwise to a new guesser and start a fresh round.

In a 4-5 player game, everyone guesses twice.

In a larger game, everyone guesses once.

If you want to fish for longer, go ahead!

**Whoever has the most points at the end wins!**

# [Chameleon](chameleon.html)

### AIM

To unmask the Chameleon without giving away the secret word. If you are the Chameleon then your mission is to blend in with the other players, avoid detection and work out the secret word.

### PREP

Gather 4-6 players. Shuffle the Blue Chameleon Card into the matching set of Code Cards and deal one to each player, face down. One of you is now the Chameleon. Stay cool, blend in and don't get caught.

### THE HUNT BEGINS...

The dealer turns over a Topic Card for all to see and rolls the yellow and blue dice. The two numbers on the dice lead everyone (except the Chameleon) to a secret coordinate on their Code Card. This coordinate is then used to locate the secret word on the Topic Card in front of them.

### UNMASKING THE CHAMELEON

Once everyone has said their word, begin debating the Chameleon's identity. This is where you get to channel your inner attorney and pick holes in each other's arguments. After a few minutes, everyone votes by pointing at the person they think is the Chameleon.

The player with the most votes must now turn over their card *(if two players receive an equal number of votes, the dealer for that round gets the deciding vote)*. If it's a Code Card, you've accused the wrong player and the Chameleon has escaped. Idiots! If it's a Chameleon Card, then you've successfully cornered the Chameleon... but it's not over yet. The Chameleon can still take a guess at the secret word. If they get it right, they escape.

The Chameleon for that round is now the dealer for the next. First switch decks, mix the Green Chameleon Card and matching set of Code Cards up and deal them out. It's time to track down that elusive Chameleon once again.

### MORE OR FEWER PLAYERS?

**3 PLAYERS**

An easy rule change is that the Chameleon, if caught, gets two guesses at the secret word.

**7 OR 8 PLAYERS**

Another simple change. Once everyone has said their word, have the dealer turn the Topic Card face-down to make it harder for the Chameleon to work out the secret word.

### SCORING (optional)

If you want to prove once and for all who's the best player around, you'll need to keep score.

Here's a simple scoring guide:

- If the Chameleon escapes undetected:
  - The Chameleon scores 2 points.
  - Everyone else scores O points.
- If the Chameleon is caught (but guesses the secret word):
  - The Chameleon scores 1 point.
  - Everyone else scores O points.
- If the Chameleon is caught (and doesn't guess the secret word):
  - The Chameleon scores O points.
  - Everyone else scores 2 points.

**The first player to 5 points wins.**

### RULES FOR 4 TO 8 PLAYERS

A cooperative game: all the players are on the same team.
A game consists of 5 rounds.

**Setup:**

- Set a number of players.
- Randomly choose a Captain for the 1st round (the player to his left will be the Captain for the 2nd round, etc).

**A round:**

1. The Captain takes the 1st Theme card and reads one of the 2 themes aloud.
2. Deal a Number card to each player face down. They look at their own card without letting the other players see.
3. The Captain and then the other players in any order, invent and say a response corresponding to their secret number.
   THE INTENSITY OF THE ANSWER DEPENDS ON THE NUMBER
   FROM 1 (IN GREEN) TO 10 (IN RED).
4. Then, the Captain must guess the ORDER of the answers, from the lowest to the highest number:
   - he names a player,
   - this player puts his Number card face up on the mat,
   - the same goes for each player’s card (including his own).

> ❗❗
> If a card is lower than the previous one: move a token from the unicorn zone to the poop zone. And the round continues.

> ℹ 
> • If at any time all the tokens are in the poop zone : the game is over!
> • If any tokens are left in the unicorn zone at the end of the 5th round: you win!

### RULES WITH 9 PLAYERS

Start with 8 tokens in the unicorn zone : there will only be 8 responses per round.
The CAP’TEN does not have a number and does not make up an answer. He just
guesses the order of the other players’ responses.

**TO NOTE**

The remaining Number cards stay face down.
You ONLY move a token to the poop zone if the PREVIOUS card is higher: Card 4 is
turned over, then card 2 → a token moves to the poop zone. But if you then turn over
the 3 card, it is fine, because 3 is higher than 2.
The responses:
The goal is to answer (words, gestures...) relating to the Theme. You are not allowed
to say the number of your card, even indirectly. For example, with the number 3, you
cannot say “it is 3 degrees” or “like the little pigs”.
You can repeat the response but you cannot change it.
New round :
Take back all the Number cards: the ones on the mat and the ones which were not used.
Do not touch the tokens.

### EXPERT VERSION

FOR THE ONES WHO HAVE BEEN PRACTICING!
Make the following adjustments (the other rules remain the same):
At the 4 point in a round:

- Before naming a player, the CAP’TEN has to say the exact value of the card to be turned
  over. For every mistake they make, a token moves to the poop zone on the mat.
- In addition, the CAP’TEN does not reveal their own card.
  Notes : - ascending order no longer matters
- the CAP’TEN can say the same number more than once

When all the other players’ Number cards have been revealed on the mat, the players
have to agree on the number on the CAP’TEN’s card.
→ If they say the correct number, a token from the poop zone returns to the unicorn
zone.
→ If it is incorrect, they do not lose an extra token.
Then a new round begins.

# [Sheeple](sheeple.html)
Can you blend into the crowd? 
One player will read the question to the group. All other players must then attempt to answer the question in the way they expect all other players to answer. 

If you blend, you earn a point. If you are the odd one out, then you may earn the dreaded **Black Sheep**, making it impossible to win the game while it is in your possession. Stay with the crowd, give simple answers, and the game could be yours. 

### SETUP
The player who has last seen a live sheep is the **Leader of the Herd**. They will be in charge of reading the questions throughout the course of the game.

Give everyone an answer pad and a pencil. The game is ready to begin! 

### GAMEPLAY
The **Leader of the Herd** will begin the game by reading a question prompted by the question card. All players will then write an answer on their answer sheet. The goal is to write the same answer as everyone else. Remember, keep that herd mentality. 

After everyone has answered, go around the group and have each player read their answer aloud. If a player’s answer matches the majority, they earn one point. If there is a majority tie, then none of the players earn a point.

If all players but one have the same answer, the odd man out gets to keep the **Black Sheep**! This is severe punishment for not sticking with the herd.

If a player has the **Black Sheep**, they are unable to win the game, but they can continue to earn points.

The only way to rid yourself of the **Black Sheep** is if another player is the odd man out. In that situation, you can then pass the **Black Sheep** to them.

Continue to play the game until a player earns eight points.

### END OF GAME
The game is over when a player collects **eight points**! This player is the winner.
