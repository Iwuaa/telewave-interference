# Telewave - Basic instructions

(The game is avaliable in [many languages](/telewave/lang/langs))

* [Good video explaining the game](https://youtu.be/KuL_R60_320?t=225)
* The basis of this implementation is that **each seed generates a unique board**.
  * This means that when two people input the same seed, they will have the same target position and words.
  * It is possible then for the **clue giver** to open the board on their own computer/phone and **peek** at the target without having to share it in the videocall.
  * The copy button besides the seed will automatically copy a link with the current seed to the clipboard.
* Functions:
  * Seed: generates a unique board. The seed can be **any combination of numbers and letters**. (Tip: using words makes it easier to share the seed.)
  * New clue: generates a new random seed.
  * Guess: Compares your current position of the dial against the target, and shows you how many points you got.
  * Peek: reveals the target.
  * Clear: Erases the target and guess from the board.
  * Percentages: Toggles the display of the percentages under the dial. (The official rulebook advises against using percentages to discuss the dial, yet I've found that they make playing via videocall much easier.)
  * There are two manual score boards at the bottom for keeping track of your points.

# Sounds Fishy
### The aim of the game
In Sounds Fishy, you’ll be trying to reel in the questioner with your lie; tempting them with a slippery red herring, or convincing them the true blue kipper is just bait.

### Setup
Pick a  guesser and give them the stack of question cards with the blue answer facing down.
Take an amount of fish equal to the number of remaining players, making sure they’re all red herrings apart from one - the true blue kipper.
Serve them at random to each other player, face down so that the colour can't be seen.
Take a peek at your little  fishy, but don’t let the guesser see!

### Gameplay
Each round the guesser draws a question, holds it up with the blue answer facing away from them, so everyone else can see and reads it aloud.

Then, everyone has 15 seconds to craft a fishy little answer.

- **Red Herrings** must attempt to make the guesser think their lie is the truth.
- **The True Blue Kipper** must give the answer on the back of the card, while making it sound suspicious.

Now the guesser goes to work, trying to sort the fishy facts from fiction. Going around the table they must eliminate red herrings, flipping over fish one by one.

### Scoring
**If you're the guesser:**
- For every red herring you catch, score 1 point.
- Catch all the red herrings, without turning over the true blue kipper and score 1 bonus point.
- If the blue kipper lands in your net, you score nothing at all!

If you’re a frightened fisherman, you can stop guessing and bank the points of your measly little haul.

**If you're a fish:**
- **Red Herrings** score 1 point for every fish flipped, including the Kipper.
However, if your fish gets flipped, you score nothing.
- **The True Blue Kipper** is the opposite - they gain 1 point for every un-flipped fish on the table. If they don’t get flipped, they score nothing.

### Game End
After scoring concludes, pass the cards clockwise to a new guesser and start a fresh round.

In a 4-5 player game, everyone guesses twice.

In a larger game, everyone guesses once.

If you want to fish for longer, go ahead!

**Whoever has the most points at the end wins!**
