### RULES FOR 4 TO 8 PLAYERS

A cooperative game: all the players are on the same team.
A game consists of 5 rounds.

**Setup:**

- Set a number of players.
- Randomly choose a Captain for the 1st round (the player to his left will be the Captain for the 2nd round, etc).

**A round:**

1. The Captain takes the 1st Theme card and reads one of the 2 themes aloud.
2. Deal a Number card to each player face down. They look at their own card without letting the other players see.
3. The Captain and then the other players in any order, invent and say a response corresponding to their secret number.
   THE INTENSITY OF THE ANSWER DEPENDS ON THE NUMBER
   FROM 1 (IN GREEN) TO 10 (IN RED).
4. Then, the Captain must guess the ORDER of the answers, from the lowest to the highest number:
   - he names a player,
   - this player puts his Number card face up on the mat,
   - the same goes for each player’s card (including his own).

> ❗❗
> If a card is lower than the previous one: move a token from the unicorn zone to the poop zone. And the round continues.

> ℹ
> • If at any time all the tokens are in the poop zone : the game is over!
> • If any tokens are left in the unicorn zone at the end of the 5th round: you win!

### RULES WITH 9 PLAYERS

Start with 8 tokens in the unicorn zone : there will only be 8 responses per round.
The CAP’TEN does not have a number and does not make up an answer. He just
guesses the order of the other players’ responses.

**TO NOTE**

The remaining Number cards stay face down.
You ONLY move a token to the poop zone if the PREVIOUS card is higher: Card 4 is
turned over, then card 2 → a token moves to the poop zone. But if you then turn over
the 3 card, it is fine, because 3 is higher than 2.
The responses:
The goal is to answer (words, gestures...) relating to the Theme. You are not allowed
to say the number of your card, even indirectly. For example, with the number 3, you
cannot say “it is 3 degrees” or “like the little pigs”.
You can repeat the response but you cannot change it.
New round :
Take back all the Number cards: the ones on the mat and the ones which were not used.
Do not touch the tokens.

### EXPERT VERSION

FOR THE ONES WHO HAVE BEEN PRACTICING!
Make the following adjustments (the other rules remain the same):
At the 4 point in a round:

- Before naming a player, the CAP’TEN has to say the exact value of the card to be turned
  over. For every mistake they make, a token moves to the poop zone on the mat.
- In addition, the CAP’TEN does not reveal their own card.
  Notes : - ascending order no longer matters
- the CAP’TEN can say the same number more than once

When all the other players’ Number cards have been revealed on the mat, the players
have to agree on the number on the CAP’TEN’s card.
→ If they say the correct number, a token from the poop zone returns to the unicorn
zone.
→ If it is incorrect, they do not lose an extra token.
Then a new round begins.
