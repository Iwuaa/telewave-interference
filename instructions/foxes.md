## Playing the Game
The game is played over **six rounds**. Each round consists of a couple phases.

### Choosing Your Role
The Character Tokens are shuffled face-down. One token is dealt face-down to each player. Each player will look at their token without letting the other players see it.

Whoever is dealt the **Shepherd Dog** token will flip it over. This will let the other players know that you are not a Fox and that the other Chickens can trust that you are trying to get everyone to guess the right answer.

### The Question
The moderator will click **üñ±New question** and read it out loud. If the question is not suitable for some reason, moderator can click **üñ±üîÅ** to get new question without incrementing the round count.

The moderator will then click **üñ±ü¶ä Peek**. The voice will guide the players through the following steps:

1. Everyone closes their eyes.
2. The correct answer to the question is highlighted.
3. The Fox players open their eyesand look what the answer to the question is.
4. After five seconds Foxes close their eyes again.
5. The answers are then return to the previous state. 
6. Everyone can then open their eyes.

### The Discussion
A two minute timer is now set. The players will have two minutes to discuss the answers and try to convince the other players what answer is correct. The Chickens and Shepherd Dog are trying to figure out the correct answer. The Fox players knowing the correct answer will try to convince the other players to choose one of the incorrect answers.

### Choosing An Answer
After the players have finished discussing the answers, all of the players will have to choose one of their Answer Chips and place it face-down on the table. Chickens and the Shepherd Dog will pick the letter that corresponds to the answer that they think is correct. The Foxes will place their Fox Chip face down.

When everyone is done all of the chips are flipped over. The moderator will click **üñ±üëÄ Show Answer** to reveal the answer. Points will then be scored based on how players answered.

### Scoring
Each Chicken and Shepherd Dog that answered correctly will earn a point for the group that answered correctly. For example if two Chickens and the Shepherd Dog answered correctly, all of them will receive three points. 

Chickens/Shepherd Dog that answered incorrectly do not score points.

For each Chicken and Shepherd Dog that picked the wrong answer, all of the Fox players will earn one point.

Each players‚Äô score will be recorded on the scoresheet. If less than six rounds have been played, another round is played. The Character Tokens are shuffled and a new one is given to each player.

## End of Game
The game ends after six rounds. The player that scores the most points wins the game. If there is a tie, the tied players share the victory.
