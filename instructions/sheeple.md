Can you blend into the crowd?
One player will read the question to the group. All other players must then attempt to answer the question in the way they expect all other players to answer.

If you blend, you earn a point. If you are the odd one out, then you may earn the dreaded **Black Sheep**, making it impossible to win the game while it is in your possession. Stay with the crowd, give simple answers, and the game could be yours.

### SETUP

The player who has last seen a live sheep is the **Leader of the Herd**. They will be in charge of reading the questions throughout the course of the game.

Give everyone an answer pad and a pencil. The game is ready to begin!

### GAMEPLAY

The **Leader of the Herd** will begin the game by reading a question prompted by the question card. All players will then write an answer on their answer sheet. The goal is to write the same answer as everyone else. Remember, keep that herd mentality.

After everyone has answered, go around the group and have each player read their answer aloud. If a playerâ€™s answer matches the majority, they earn one point. If there is a majority tie, then none of the players earn a point.

If all players but one have the same answer, the odd man out gets to keep the **Black Sheep**! This is severe punishment for not sticking with the herd.

If a player has the **Black Sheep**, they are unable to win the game, but they can continue to earn points.

The only way to rid yourself of the **Black Sheep** is if another player is the odd man out. In that situation, you can then pass the **Black Sheep** to them.

Continue to play the game until a player earns eight points.

### END OF GAME

The game is over when a player collects **eight points**! This player is the winner.
