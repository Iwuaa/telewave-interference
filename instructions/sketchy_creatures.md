### Setup

**Players:** The game is best played with 3-8 players. Assign each player a number (it will be used in the voting phase).

**Cards:** Shuffle the deck of monster cards and place them in a stack face down.

**Drawing Materials:** Ensure each player has a drawing pad or paper and a pen or pencil.

**Timer**: There's a build-in timer, so you just need to turn your volume up.

### Gameplay

#### Choose the Witness:

Select a player to be the first "Witness" - it's the person who most recently watched a movie with an alien or monster in it. The Witness will be the one describing the monster for the round. The other players are called Artists - they will try to draw the monster that round.

#### Viewing the Monster:

First create üñ±Ô∏è**New Monster** (this can take a few seconds to load).

All Artists close their eyes and won't open them until they hear a gong.

The Witness **üñ±Ô∏èPeeks** at a monster and has **20 seconds to memorize** the monster‚Äôs appearance. After the 20 seconds, the monster hides again.

#### Describing the Monster:

The Witness then has **2 minutes to üñ±Ô∏èDescribe** the monster to the Artists, who will draw based on the description.

The Witness cannot use gestures or sounds and must rely solely on verbal descriptions.

While the Witness describes the monster, Artists draw what they hear.

Artists can ask the Witness questions, but the Witness cannot look at the monster during the description phase.

#### Reveal and Vote:

After 2 minutes, the Witness has to stop describing, and all Artists have to stop drawing. Artists will then reveal their drawings one by one.

The Witness secretly votes for one Artist whose drawing he thinks is the most accurate (he will write the Artists numer on his drawing pad). Then the Witness **üñ±Ô∏èShows** the monster to all players.

Players vote on the drawing they think is the most accurate representation of the monster described by the Witness. On the count of three, each Artist will hold up number of fingers corresponding with the Artist of their choosing.

#### Scoring:

The player whose drawing receives the most votes gets a point. (In case of a tie, all Artists with the highest number of votes score a point.)

If the Witness chose the same sketch that the artists ended up picking, the Witness scores one point.

#### Rotate Roles:

The role of the Witness rotates clockwise for the next round.

Continue playing until each player has had a chance to be the Witness two times or a predetermined number of rounds is completed.

### Winning the Game:

The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.
