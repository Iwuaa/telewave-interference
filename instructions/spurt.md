|**AGES 10+** | **2+ PLAYERS**|

## OBJECT

Be the first to win 7 points.

## HOW TO PLAY
Click on **🖱️New Clue**. A new theme and answer criteria shows up. All players now simultaneously race to be the first to call out an answer that matches the criteria of the two cards. Whoever calls out a correct answer first collects a oint. Click on **🖱️New Clue** to begin the next round.

### Notes:
• If two or more players tie — or if all players agree there is no answer — turn the card back to its pink side and put it at the bottom of the deck.

• If there is debate over whether an answer is valid, majority rules. A tie goes in favor of the player who gave the answer.

## ENDING THE GAME
The game ends when a player gets 7th point.
